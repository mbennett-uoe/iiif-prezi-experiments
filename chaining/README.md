# The Subclass & Chaining method

## Overview
* Main schema generated by Pydantic (`prezi3_schema.py`) is unmodified
* Classes are extended by subclassing them in extension files
* Un-modified classes are 'chained' through the extension file via `import *` pattern to allow using the last file in
the chain for all imports in the client file

### Pros
* No need to modify schema once generated - regeneration possible at any time
* Chaining means you don't have to import different models from different files

### Cons
* Extended classes are not used when instantiated by parent class in schema - extensions and helpers in child objects only
  available when creating _all_ objects from scratch
* Multiple extensions must chain off each other in order - first extension must `import *` from the base, second extension
  must `import *` from the first extension, third extension must `import *` from second extension, etc

## Demos
### Single extension - `test_single.py`
This demonstrates the loading of an extended class (`Manifest`) from the `schema_extension` file
and the chained loading of a class (`Annotation`) from the main `prezi3_schema` file, via the `schema_extension` file

### Multiple extensions - `test_multiple.py`
This demonstrates multiple extensions being applied to `Manifest` (from `schema_extension` and then `schema_second_extension`)
alongside an extended class loaded from the first extension (`Canvas` from `schema_extension`), and an unextended
class chained through both extensions (`Annotation`)

### Different Canvas instantiations - `test_canvas.py`
This demonstrates the **failure** of extended classes to be used when non instantiated directly.
The script loads the extended `Canvas` from `schema_extension` and the instantiates an instance directly from JSON - 
this instance has access to the extension property. The second test loads a `Manifest` object, and demonstrates the error
caused by lack of the extension in the `Canvas` objects created by Pydantic, which still use the `prezi3_schema` version of the class
